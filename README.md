# Manual ROI segmentation for 2-photon calcium imaging

Manual segmentation of 2p calcium imaging, mostly for time series images (can be used with static images as well, but it's not optimal in terms of useful information provided. Will work on that for a future release).

If you would like to use any of the scripts in the repository, please contact me first.
