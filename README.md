# Manual ROI segmentation for 2-photon calcium imaging

Manual segmentation of 2p calcium imaging, mostly for time series images (can be used with static images as well, but it's not optimal in terms of useful information provided. Will work on that for a future release).

Actual scripts coming soon - July 2017
